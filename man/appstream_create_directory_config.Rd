\title{Creates a Directory Config object in AppStream 2}
\usage{
appstream_create_directory_config(
  DirectoryName,
  OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedNames,
  ServiceAccountCredentials = NULL,
  CertificateBasedAuthProperties = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DirectoryName}{[required] The fully qualified name of the directory (for example,
corp.example.com).}

\item{OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedNames}{[required] The distinguished names of the organizational units for computer
accounts.}

\item{ServiceAccountCredentials}{The credentials for the service account used by the fleet or image
builder to connect to the directory.}

\item{CertificateBasedAuthProperties}{The certificate-based authentication properties used to authenticate
SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities to Active Directory
domain-joined streaming instances. Fallback is turned on by default when
certificate-based authentication is \strong{Enabled} . Fallback allows users
to log in using their AD domain password if certificate-based
authentication is unsuccessful, or to unlock a desktop lock screen.
\strong{Enabled_no_directory_login_fallback} enables certificate-based
authentication, but does not allow users to log in using their AD domain
password. Users will be disconnected to re-authenticate using
certificates.}
